I am a recent graduate from University of California, Santa Cruz with a Ph.D. degree in technology information management. During my doctorate study, I have devoted myself to using modern computer technologies to solve large system problems, with a special focus on energy systems. I'm proficient in data structures and algorithms, object-oriented programming, full-stack web developemt and android app development. I'm actively seeking opportunities in becoming a full-time software engineer.
