Designed and implemented a mini Instagram full stack django application.

\- The overall functionality of this full stack web application includes: authentication, authorization,

follow/unfollow user, making posts, master/detail view of posts, etc…

\- Designed and implemented the front end interface using html, bootstrap, javascript, allowing

user to interact with the application for all mentioned modules.

\- Designed and implemented the database + wrapper layer using django model, to support

application’s business logic.

\- Implemented django views to handle different web requests using python. Added logs and

proper unit tests for these views as well.

\- Deployed the web application to Heroku to enable public access.
