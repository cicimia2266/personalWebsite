In this project, I have designed and developed a Kids Drawing Android App with Kotlin. You will be able to customize your stoke width and paint colors, and undo your previous drawings. The app supports importing image so that you can sketch along with the picture of your choice. You are also able to export the drawing and share it with friends.
