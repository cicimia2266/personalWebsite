In this project, I have designed and developed a Kids Drawing Android App with Kotlin. Users will be able to customize their stroke width and paint colors, and undo their previous drawings. The app supports importing image so that users can sketch along with the picture of their choices. Users are also able to export the drawing and share it with friends.
