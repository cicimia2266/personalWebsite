Weather app uses a modern and minimalist user interface to display weather information based on the current location of the Andriud device. It uses the Current Weather Data from Weather API and transform JSON data into user friendly data. It displays weather, temperature, humidity, minimal/maximal daily temperature, wind speed and sunrise/sunset time based on locational information provided by the device. Users could refresh the page anytime to get the updated weather info.
