A Study on Regional Market Impact of EPAâ€™s Clean Power Plan

- Studied the market and emission outcomes of the EPA proposed rate-based emission policy with partial equilibrium energy market modeling.

- Collected and cleaned up U.S. power plant generation characteristics and emission data, retail electricity consumption data and Pennsylvania-Jersey-Maryland (PJM) electricity market price data from multiple sources.
- Developed a security constraint economic dispatch model to study the efficiency impacts of emission policy on electricity market and ran a large-scale simulation of the PJM electricity market to quantify the magnitude of impacts, including distribution of economics rent as well as the shift of pollution emissions.

A Study on Regional Economic Impact of Climate-change-induced Hazards on Northern California Natural Gas Sector

  * Collected and cleansed industrial U.S. input-output data and transportation data and constructed a U.S. regional bilateral commodity trade flow matrix in R using gravity model.
  * Developed a macro-economic Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model in optimization software GAMS. 
  * Developed a workflow forlarge scale data computations and boosted the efficiency by ~100x using carefully designed python script.
  * Quantified the impact of climate-change-induced hazards on Northern California natural gas pipelines and facilities, especially with a focus on the cross-sector and cross-region spillover effects.
